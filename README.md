In order to run the game you must first compile the code.In order to compile you must have a compiler installed .In gcc compiler:

```
g++ TicTacToeGame.cpp
```

###
After you compile the program you can run it with:


```

Note that this tictactoe game is made for windows .

if you using linux you have to go to line 25,59,88 and replace system("cls"); with system("clear");

In case you don't do this the program will run normally but it won't clear the screen after each loop 
so in every round a new board will be created.
